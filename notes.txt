HTTP
----
Endpoints by default or customizable should:
 - trace
 - rate limit
 - authenticate (not here)
 - add custom middleware
 - log errors
 - log requests input
 - handle default 404
 - error handling accordingly to API 
 - with proxy 
 - with async after response
 - with body available after response
 - with redirect
 - ensuring https
 - with authentication
 - add headers
 - add default timeout

Options to add error handler
 - wrap response writer & loose the rest of the interfaces
   - Investigate (CloseNotifier, Flusher, Hijacker, or Pusher)
 - return status code and body so the parent handler write in response. This doesn't allow controllers to have post response tasks
